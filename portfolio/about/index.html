      About me under construction
    </h4>
    <h5>Hey, I’m Graham. I’m a student High Point University studying computer science. I’m always looking for new challenges and ways to grow myself. I’m originally from Ocean City, Maryland, and I’ve always had a curiosity for how things work, especially when it comes to technology. Whether I’m coding a new project, learning a new skill, or tackling a tough problem, I’m motivated by the process of figuring things out and improving along the way. I love staying busy, pushing myself to learn more, and finding creative solutions to whatever comes my way.</h5>
